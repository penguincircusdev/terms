    <p>
                  By downloading or using the skill, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the skill. You’re not
                  allowed to copy, or modify the skill, any part of the skill, or
                  our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                  extract the source code of the skill, and you also shouldn’t try
                  to translate the skill into other languages, or make derivative
                  versions. The skill itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                  database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                  to it, still belong to Rose Garner.
                </p> <p>
                  Rose Garner is committed to ensuring that the skill is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                  reserve the right to make changes to the skill or to charge for
                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                  charge you for the skill or its services without making it very
                  clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                </p> <p>
                  The Test skill stores and processes personal data that
                  you have provided to us, in order to provide my
                  Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                  access to the skill secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                  compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                  that the Test skill won’t work properly or at all.
                </p> <div><p>
                    The skill does use third party services that declare their own
                    Terms and Conditions.

                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  Rose Garner will not take responsibility for. Certain
                  functions of the skill will require the skill to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                  by your mobile network provider, but Rose Garner
                  cannot take responsibility for the skill not working at full
                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                  have any of your data allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you’re using the skill outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the skill, or
                  other third party charges. In using the skill, you’re accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the skill outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                  using the skill, please be aware that we assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the skill.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, Rose Garner cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the skill i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                  Rose Garner cannot accept responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to Rose Garner’s responsibility for your
                  use of the skill, when you’re using the skill, it’s important to
                  bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. Rose Garner accepts no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the skill.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, we may wish to update the skill. The skill is
                  currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                  both systems(and for any additional systems we
                  decide to extend the availability of the skill to) may change,
                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the skill. Rose Garner does not promise that it
                  will always update the skill so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                  also wish to stop providing the skill, and may terminate use of
                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                  (b) you must stop using the skill, and (if needed) delete it
                  from your device.
                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
